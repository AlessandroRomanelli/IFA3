          <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Front:_Liberation_1944" target="_blank">Iron Front</a> is a tactical shooter videogame set in the Eastern Front of World War 2, built by <a href="http://awar.su/en/about-us.html" target="_blank">AWAR</a> - a group of former OFP and senior ArmA modders.</p>

          <h2>Where are we going?</h2>
          <p>Our development team has ported the original game assets to <a href="https://arma3.com/" target="_blank">ArmA3</a>  for them to be able to run on the latest RV engine by <i> Bohemia Interactive Studios</i>.</p>
          <p>This most recent, ported version of Iron Front, called <i> IFA3</i>, takes advantage and merges many of the new technologies and features of ArmA3 and it's continously developed to provide a fully supported, enjoyable, bug-free version of Iron Front.</p>
